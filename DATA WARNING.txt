The example datasets presented under "tests" MUST NOT be relied upon!

They were either created at an early stage in the NanoPUZZLES project (http://www.nanopuzzles.eu) - with the final versions having undergone revision - or are simply invented for the purposes of testing!

In some cases, real datasets may have been edited (with no consideration of consistency with the original references) to test certain aspects of the code!
